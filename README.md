# 🧠 Python Parallel Text Handling Processor

## 📌 Project Description

The Python Parallel Text Handling Processor is a multi-tasking text analysis system developed using Python.  
It processes large text datasets efficiently by breaking them into smaller chunks and executing tasks simultaneously using multi-threading or multi-processing.

The system performs rule-based sentiment scoring, pattern detection, searchable storage, CSV export, and automated email summaries.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of parallel computing and structured text mining without requiring advanced NLP frameworks.
